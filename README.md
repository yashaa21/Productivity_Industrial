## üéØ Calculator Types Explained

### Total Productivity
Measures the overall efficiency by comparing total output to total input.

### Labour Productivity
Indicates how efficiently human resources are being utilized in the production process.

### Material Productivity
Shows how effectively materials are being converted into output.

### Capital Productivity
Measures the efficiency of capital investment in generating output.

### Machine Productivity
Indicates how efficiently machinery and equipment are being utilized.

### Miscellaneous Productivity
Measures the efficiency of other inputs not covered by the main categories.

### Multifactor Productivity
Considers multiple input factors (human, material, capital, energy, misc) simultaneously.

### Total Factor Productivity
Focuses on the relationship between net output and combined worker and machine inputs.

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
Helps optimize inventory costs by finding the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs.
